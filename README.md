# Nexfuse Framework

Nexfuse is a Python-based framework inspired by the NSA's Marble Framework, designed to enhance anti-forensics techniques for malware developers. This tool is made using AI, it translate comments within code written in various programming languages into different languages such as Russian, Chinese, Arabic, Urdu, and English. By obfuscating comments through translation, Nexfuse aims to make it more challenging for analysts to trace the origin and intent of the code, thereby aiding in evading forensic detection. Although this is my first time making a framework and I am not an experienced programmer, I have tried my best to create a functional tool. I will not be responsible for any illegal activity carried out using this tool.
